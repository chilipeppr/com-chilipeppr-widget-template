TODO LIST:

- Check errors in the serial console throwed by grbl when hold-resume or door-resume multiple times (I've got: error:25 error:33 error:33 error:2)
- issues with units not changing properly.  need to discuss.




DONE:

- UI resume button now changes if door / hold status has been matched on status (so if CP is reloaded status is correct)
- corrected the toggle panel display button
